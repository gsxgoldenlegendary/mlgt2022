#### 5.5.59 G

>Let $R$ be the relation on the set of all colorings of the $2 × 2$ checkerboard where each of the four squares is colored either red or blue so that $(C_ 1 , C _2 )$, where $C_ 1$ and $C _2$ are $2 × 2$ checkerboards with each of their four squares colored blue or red, belongs to $R$ if and only if $C _2$ can be obtained from $C _1$ either by rotating the checkerboard or by rotating it and then reﬂecting it.

#### 5.5.63 G

>Do we necessarily get an equivalence relation when we form the transitive closure of the symmetric closure of the reﬂexive closure of a relation?
