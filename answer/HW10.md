>a) How many nonisomorphic unrooted trees are there with ﬁve vertices?
>b) How many nonisomorphic rooted trees are there with ﬁve vertices (using isomorphism for directed graphs)?

a)3种，形状上来说，树枝个数和各树枝结点数分别是4个1，1个2和2个1,2个2。

b)9，形状上来说，自己画吧，并不难。

#### 7.1.21 C

>Suppose $1000$ people enter a chess tournament. Use a rooted tree model of the tournament to determine how
>many games must be played to determine a champion, if a player is eliminated after one loss and games are played until only one entrant has not lost. (Assume there are no ties.)
