#### 2.1.11

>Determine whether each of these statements is true or false.
>a) $0 ∈ ∅$
>b) $∅ ∈ \{0\}$
>c) $\{0\} ⊂ ∅$
>d) $ ∅ ⊂ \{0\}$
>e) $\{0\} ∈ \{0\}$
>f ) $\{0\} ⊂ \{0\}$
>g) $\{∅\} ⊆ \{∅\}$

#### 2.1.27

> Prove that $\mathcal P(A) ⊆ \mathcal P(B)$ if and only if $A ⊆ B$.

#### 2.1.41

> Explain why $A × B × C$ and $(A × B) × C$ are not the same.

#### 2.1.43

>Prove or disprove that if $A$ and $B$ are sets, then $\mathcal P(A × B) =\mathcal P(A) × \mathcal P(B)$.

#### 2.1.49

>The deﬁning property of an ordered pair is that two ordered pairs are equal if and only if their ﬁrst elements are
>equal and their second elements are equal. Surprisingly, instead of taking the ordered pair as a primitive concept, we can construct ordered pairs using basic notions from set theory. Show that if we deﬁne the ordered pair $(a, b)$ to be $\{\{a\}, \{a, b\}\}$, then $(a, b) = (c, d)$ if and only if $a = c$ and $b = d$. 

#### 2.2.19

>Show that if $A$, $B$, and $C$ are sets, then $A ∩ B ∩ C = A ∪B ∪ C$
>a) by showing each side is a subset of the other side.
>b) using a membership table.

#### 2.2.35

>Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be sets. Use the identities in Table 1 to show that $(A ∪ B) ∩ (B ∪ C) ∩ (A ∪ C) = A ∩ B ∩ C$.

#### 2.2.47

>Suppose that $A$, $B$, and $C$ are sets such that $A ⊕ C =B ⊕ C$. Must it be the case that $A = B$?
