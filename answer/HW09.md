#### 6.5.9 G

>Suppose that in addition to the seven bridges of Königsberg (shown in Figure 1) there were two additional bridges, connecting regions $B$ and $C$ and regions $B$ and $D$, respectively. Could someone cross all nine of these bridges exactly once and return to the starting point?

>Determine whether the directed graph shown has an Euler circuit. Construct an Euler circuit if one exists. If no Euler circuit exists, determine whether the di rected graph has an Euler path. Construct an Euler path if one exists.

#### 6.5.45 G

>For which values of $m$ and $n$ does the complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$ have a Hamilton circuit?

#### 6.5.47 G

>For each of these graphs, determine (i ) whether Dirac’s theorem can be used to show that the graph has a Hamilton circuit, (ii) whether Ore’s theorem can be used to show that the graph has a Hamilton circuit, and (iii )
>whether the graph has a Hamilton circuit.

#### 6.5.63 C

>Show that there is no reentrant knight’s tour on an $m × n$ chessboard when $m$ and $n$ are both odd.

这是个二分图，但黑格子有奇数个，白格子有偶数个，没有哈密顿回路，所以走不出重返周游。

#### 6.6.3 C

>ﬁnd the length of a shortest path between $a$ and $z$ in the given weighted graph.

16。a-c-d-e-g-z。

#### 6.6.27 C

>Find a route with the least total airfare that visits each of the cities in this graph, where the weight on an edge is the least price available for a ﬂight between the two cities.

回路是旧金山-丹弗-底特律-纽约-洛杉矶-旧金山。

#### 6.6.31 C

>The longest path problem in a weighted directed graph with no simple circuits asks for a path in this graph such
>that the sum of its edge weights is a maximum. Devise an algorithm for solving the longest path problem.

先构建点的拓扑排序$v_1,v_2,...,v_n$，记边权值为$w(i,j)$，记$P(i)$表示终点为$i$的最长路径的权值，迭代$P(i)=max(P(j)+w(j,i))(j<i)$，找不到$j$时$P(i)=0$；这样所有点作为终点的$P(i)$都算出来了，选最大的即可。
