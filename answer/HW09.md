#### 6.5.9 G

>Suppose that in addition to the seven bridges of Königsberg (shown in Figure 1) there were two additional bridges, connecting regions $B$ and $C$ and regions $B$ and $D$, respectively. Could someone cross all nine of these bridges exactly once and return to the starting point?

#### 6.5.23 G

>Determine whether the directed graph shown has an Euler circuit. Construct an Euler circuit if one exists. If no Euler circuit exists, determine whether the di rected graph has an Euler path. Construct an Euler path if one exists.

#### 6.5.45 G

>For which values of $m$ and $n$ does the complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$ have a Hamilton circuit?

#### 6.5.47 G

>For each of these graphs, determine (i ) whether Dirac’s theorem can be used to show that the graph has a Hamilton circuit, (ii) whether Ore’s theorem can be used to show that the graph has a Hamilton circuit, and (iii )
>whether the graph has a Hamilton circuit.

#### 6.6.31 C

>The longest path problem in a weighted directed graph with no simple circuits asks for a path in this graph such
>that the sum of its edge weights is a maximum. Devise an algorithm for solving the longest path problem.
