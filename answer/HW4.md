#### 3.1.41 C

> A palindrome is a string whose reversal is identical to the string. How many bit strings of length n are palindromes?

#### 3.1.53 C

>How many bit strings of length eight contain either three consecutive 0s or four consecutive 1s?

#### 3.1.77 C

>How many diagonals does a convex polygon with n sides have? (Recall that a polygon is convex if every line segment connecting two points in the interior or boundary of the polygon lies entirely within this set and that a diagonal of a polygon is a line segment connecting two vertices that are not adjacent.)

#### 3.2.13 C

>Let $(x_i , y_ i , z_ i ), i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$, be a set of nined istinct points with integer coordinates in xyz space.
>Show that the midpoint of at least one pair of these points has integer coordinates.

#### 3.2.15 G

>- a) Show that if ﬁve integers are selected from the ﬁrst eight positive integers, there must be a pair of these
>  integers with a sum equal to 9.
>- b) Is the conclusion in part (a) true if four integers are selected rather than ﬁve?

#### 3.2.25 G

>Show that whenever 25 girls and 25 boys are seated around a circular table there is always a person both of
>whose neighbors are boys.

#### 3.2.49 G

>An alternative proof of Theorem 3 based on the generalized pigeonhole principle is outlined in this exercise. The
>notation used is the same as that used in the proof in the text.
>
>- a) Assume that $i_k ≤ n$ for $k = 1, 2, … , n^ 2 + 1$. Use the generalized pigeonhole principle to show that there are $n + 1$ terms $a _{k_ 1} , a _{k_ 2} , \cdots, a _{k_ n}+1$ with $i _{k _1} = i_{ k _2} = \cdots = i_ {k_ n}+1$ , where $1 ≤ k_ 1 < k_ 2 < ⋯ < k _{n+1}$ .
>- b) Show that $a _{k _j} > a _{k _j}+1$ for $j = 1, 2, \cdots , n$. 
>- c) Use parts (a) and (b) to show that if there is no increasing subsequence of length $n + 1$, then there must be a decreasing subsequence of this length.
